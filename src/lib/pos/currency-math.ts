/**
 * Multi-currency arithmetic: a verbatim copy of top-backend/src/currency/currency-math.ts
 * (currency-math.test.ts checks they stay identical; re-copy rather than edit).
 *
 * Sales are priced in the store currency. Customers may also pay in the other
 * currencies of `exchangeRates`, where each rate is how many units of that currency
 * one unit of the store currency buys (e.g. { HTG: 132.5 } for 1 USD = 132.50 HTG).
 *
 * Two rates per currency: `exchangeRates` is the SELL rate, used whenever that
 * currency comes in and is valued in the store currency (a customer paying in HTG:
 * the amount asked and the value of what is handed over). `exchangeBuyRates` is the
 * BUY rate, used whenever store-currency money is turned into that currency (change
 * in HTG for dollars paid). A currency without a buy rate uses its sell rate.
